                <h2>Final Essay</h2>
                <p>In Writing and Critical Thinking, I wrote a final essay evaluating two candidates for the 
                    Ontario Tech University Board of Governors, Jordan Jacobs (AI and technology) and Ahmad 
                    Ghahreman (sustainability and recycling). I based my evalutaions on our universities specific 
                    priorities like student success, innovation, industry partnerships, or Co-op, etc. Based on this, 
                    Jordan Jacobs is the better fit due to his expertise in AI innovation, and his goals align with 
                    our university's priorities.

                <h2>Grade Book project</h2>
                <p>In Object Oriented Programming, I created python code that would emulate a teachers gradebook for a 
                    student. In this code, you could create a student by making their student id and linking it with their 
                    name, then you can enroll them into a class and enter a grade for them. My code also wouldnt let you 
                    enroll a student for a class that they were already in, as well as it won’t let you enter a grade for 
                    a student that wasn’t in a certian class, or didn’t exist.
